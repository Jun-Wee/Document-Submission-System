The Longest River the Nile is 4,160 miles long-the worldâs longest river. It begins near the equator in Africa and flows north to the Mediterranean Sea. In the south the Nile churns with cataracts. A cataract is a waterfall. Near the sea the Nile branches into a delta. A delta is an area near a riverâs mouth where the water deposits fine soil called silt. In the delta, the Nile divides into many streams. The river is called the upper Nile in the south and the lower Nile in the north. For centuries, heavy rains in Ethiopia caused the Nile to flood every summer. The floods deposited rich soil along the Nileâs shores. This soil was fertile, which means it was good for growing crops. Unlike the Tigris and Euphrates, the Nile River flooded at the same time every year, so farmers could predict when to plant their crops. Red Land, Black Land The ancient Egyptians lived in narrow bands of land on each side of the Nile. They called this region the black land because of the fertile soil that the floods deposited. The red land was the barren desert beyond the fertile region. Weather in Egypt was almost always the same. Eight months of the year were sunny and hot. The four months of winter were sunny but cooler. Most of the region received only an inch of rain a year. The parts of Egypt not near the Nile were a desert. Isolation The harsh desert acted as a barrier to keep out enemies. The Mediterranean coast was swampy and lacked good harbors. For these reasons, early Egyptians stayed close to home. Each year, Egyptian farmers watched for white birds called ibises, which flew up from the south. When the birds arrived, the annual flood waters would soon follow. After the waters drained away, farmers could plant seeds in the fertile soil. Agricultural Techniques By about 2400 B.C., farmers used technology to expand their farmland. Working together, they dug irrigation canals that carried river water to dry areas. Then they used a tool called a shaduf to spread the water across the fields. These innovative, or new, techniques gave them more farmland. Egyptian Crops Ancient Egyptians grew a large variety of foods. They were the first to grind wheat into flour and to mix the flour with yeast and water to make dough rise into bread. They grew vegetables such as lettuce, radishes, asparagus, and cucumbers. Fruits included dates, figs, grapes, and watermelons. Egyptians also grew the materials for their clothes. They were the first to weave fibers from flax plants into a fabric called linen. Lightweight linen cloth was perfect for hot Egyptian days. Men wore linen wraps around their waists. Women wore loose, sleeveless dresses. Egyptians also wove marsh grasses into sandals. Egyptian Houses Egyptians built houses using bricks made of mud from the Nile mixed with chopped straw. They placed narrow windows high in the walls to reduce bright sunlight. Egyptians often painted walls white to reflect the blazing heat. They wove sticks and palm trees to make roofs. Inside, woven reed mats covered the dirt floor. Most Egyptians slept on mats covered with linen sheets. Wealthy citizens enjoyed bed frames and cushions. Egyptian nobles had fancier homes with tree-lined courtyards for shade. Some had a pool filled with lotus blossoms and fish. Poorer Egyptians simply went to the roof to cool off after sunset. They often cooked, ate, and even slept outside. Egyptâs economy depended on farming. However, the natural resources of the area allowed other economic activities to develop too. The Egyptians wanted valuable metals that were not found in the black land. For example, they wanted copper to make tools and weapons. Egyptians looked for copper as early as 6000 B.C. Later they learned that iron was stronger, and they sought it as well. Ancient Egyptians also desired gold for its bright beauty. The Egyptian word for gold was nub. Nubia was the Egyptian name for the area of the upper Nile that had the richest gold mines in Africa. Mining minerals was difficult. Veins (long streaks) of copper, iron, and bronze were hidden inside desert mountains in the hot Sinai Peninsula, east of Egypt. Even during the cool season, chipping minerals out of the rock was miserable work. Egyptians mined precious stones too. They were probably the first people in the world to mine turquoise. The Egyptians also mined lapis lazuli. These beautiful blue stones were used in jewelry.The Nile had fish and other wildlife that Egyptians wanted. To go on the river, Egyptians made lightweight rafts by binding together reeds. They used everything from nets to harpoons to catch fish. One ancient painting even shows a man ready to hit a catfish with a wooden hammer. More adventurous hunters speared hippopotamuses and crocodiles along the Nile. Egyptians also captured quail with nets. They used boomerangs to knock down flying ducks and geese. (A boomerang is a curved stick that returns to the person who threw it.) Eventually, Egyptians equipped their reed boats with sails and oars. The Nile then became a highway. The riverâs current was slow, so boaters used paddles to go faster when they traveled north with the current. Going south, they raised a sail and let the winds that blew in that direction push them. The Nile provided so well for Egyptians that sometimes they had surpluses, or more goods than they needed. They began to trade with each other. Ancient Egypt had no money, so people exchanged goods that they grew or made. This method of trade is called bartering. Egypt prospered along the Nile. This prosperity made life easier and provided greater opportunities for many Egyptians. When farmers produce food surpluses, the societyâs economy begins to expand. Cities emerge as centers of culture and power, and people learn to do jobs that do not involve agriculture. For example, some ancient Egyptians learned to be scribes, people whose job was to write and keep records. As Egyptian civilization grew more complex, people took on jobs other than that of a farmer or scribe. Some skilled artisans erected stone or brick houses and temples. Other artisans made pottery, incense, mats, furniture, linen clothing, sandals, or jewelry. A few Egyptians traveled to the upper Nile to trade with other Africans. These traders took Egyptian products such as scrolls, linen, gold, and jewelry. They brought back exotic woods, animal skins, and live beasts. As Egypt grew, so did its need to organize. Egyptians created a government that divided the empire into 42 provinces. Many officials worked to keep the provinces running smoothly. Egypt also created an army to defend itself. One of the highest jobs in Egypt was to be a priest. Priests followed formal rituals and took care of the temples. Before entering a temple, a priest bathed and put on special linen garments and white sandals. Priests cleaned the sacred statues in temples, changed their clothes, and even fed them meals. Together, the priests and the ruler held ceremonies to please the gods. Egyptians believed that if the gods were angry, the Nile would not flood. As a result, crops would not grow, and people would die. So the ruler and the priests tried hard to keep the gods happy. By doing so, they hoped to maintain the social and political order. Slaves were at the bottom of society. In Egypt, people became slaves if they owed a debt, committed a crime, or were captured in war. Egyptian slaves were usually freed after a period of time. One exception was the slaves who had to work in the mines. Many died from the exhausting labor. Egypt was one of the best places in the ancient world to be a woman. Unlike other ancient African cultures, in Egyptian society men and women had fairly equal rights. For example, they could both own and manage their own property. The main job of most women was to care for their children and home, but some did other jobs too. Some women wove cloth. Others worked with their husbands in fields or workshops. Some women, such as Queen Tiy, even rose to important positions in the government. Children in Egypt played with toys such as dolls, animal figures, board games, and marbles. Their parents made the toys from wood or clay. Boys and girls also played rough physical games with balls made of leather or reeds. Boys and some girls from wealthy families went to schools run by scribes or priests. Most other children learned their parentsâ jobs. Almost all Egyptians married when they were in their early teens. As in many ancient societies, much of the knowledge of Egypt came about as priests studied the world to find ways to please the gods. Other advances came about because of practical discoveries. Egyptian priests studied the sky as part of their religion. About 5,000 years ago, they noticed that a star now called Sirius appeared shortly before the Nile began to flood. The star returned to the same position in 365 days. Based on that, Egyptians developed the worldâs first practical calendar. The Egyptians developed some of the first geometry. Each year the Nileâs floods washed away land boundaries. To restore property lines, surveyors measured the land by using ropes that were knotted at regular intervals. Geometric shapes such as squares and triangles were sacred to Egyptians. Architects used them in the design of royal temples and monuments. Egyptian doctors often prepared dead bodies for burial, so they knew the parts of the body. That knowledge helped them perform some of the worldâs first surgery. Some doctors specialized in using medicines made of herbs. Egyptian medicine was far from perfect. Doctors believed that the heart controlled thought and the brain circulated blood, which is the opposite of what is known now. Some Egyptian treatments would raise eyebrows today. One âcureâ for an upset stomach was to eat a hogâs tooth crushed inside sugar cakes! Beginning about 3000 B.C., Egyptians developed a writing system using hieroglyphs. Hieroglyphs Hieroglyphs are pictures that stand for different words or sounds. Early Egyptians created a hieroglyphic system with about 700 characters. Over time the system grew to include more than 6,000 symbols. The Egyptians also developed a paperlike material called papyrus papyrus from a reed of the same name. Egyptians cut the stems into strips, pressed them, and dried them into sheets that could be rolled into scrolls. Papyrus scrolls were light and easy to carry. With them, Egyptians created some of the first books. Legend says a king named Narmer united Upper and Lower Egypt. Some historians think Narmer actually represents several kings who gradually joined the two lands. After Egypt was united, its ruler wore the Double Crown. It combined the red Crown of Lower Egypt with the white Crown of Upper Egypt. The first dynasty of the Egyptian empire began about 2925 B.C. A dynasty is a line of rulers from the same family. When a king died, one of his children usually took his place as ruler. The order in which members of a royal family inherit a throne is called the succession. More than 30 dynasties ruled ancient Egypt. Historians divide ancient Egyptian dynasties into the Old Kingdom, the Middle Kingdom, and the New Kingdom. The Old Kingdom started about 2575 B.C., when the Egyptian empire was gaining strength. The king of Egypt became known as the pharaoh pharaoh. The word pharaoh meant âgreat house,â and it was originally used to describe the kingâs palace. Later it became the title of the king himself. The pharaoh ruled from the capital city of Memphis. The ancient Egyptians thought the pharaoh was a child of the gods and a god himself. Egyptians believed that if the pharaoh and his subjects honored the gods, their lives would be happy. If Egypt suffered hard times for a long period, the people blamed the pharaoh for angering the gods. In such a case, a rival might drive him from power and start a new dynasty. Because the pharaoh was thought to be a god, government and religion were not separate in ancient Egypt. Priests had much power in the government. Many high officials were priests. The first rulers of Egypt were often buried in an underground tomb topped by mud brick. Soon, kings wanted more permanent monuments. They replaced the mud brick with a small pyramid of brick or stone. A pyramid is a structure shaped like a triangle, with four sides that meet at a point. About 2630 B.C., King Djoser built a much larger pyramid over his tomb. It is called a step pyramid because its sides rise in a series of giant steps. It is the oldest-known large stone structure in the world. About 80 years later, a pharaoh named Khufu decided he wanted a monument that would show the world how great he was. He ordered the construction of the largest pyramid ever built. Along its base, each side was about 760 feet long. The core was built from 2.3 million blocks of stone. Building the Great Pyramid was hard work. Miners cut the huge blocks of stone using copper saws and chisels. These tools were much softer than the iron tools developed later. Other teams of workers pulled the stone slabs up long, sloping ramps to their place on the pyramid. Near the top of the pyramid, the ramps ended. Workers dragged each heavy block hundreds of feet and then set it in place. Farmers did the heavy labor of hauling stone during the season when the Nile flooded their fields. Skilled stonecutters and overseers worked year-round. The Great Pyramid took nearly 20 years to build. An estimated 20,000 Egyptians worked on it. A city called Giza was built for the pyramid workers and the people who fed, clothed, and housed them. Eventually, Egyptians stopped building pyramids. One reason is that the pyramids drew attention to the tombs inside them. Grave robbers broke into the tombs to steal the treasure buried with the pharaohs. Sometimes they also stole the mummies. Egyptians believed that if a tomb was robbed, the person buried there could not have a happy afterlife. During the New Kingdom, pharaohs began building more secret tombs in an area called the Valley of the Kings. The burial chambers were hidden in mountains near the Nile. This way, the pharaohs hoped to protect their bodies and treasures from robbers. Both the pyramids and later tombs had several passageways leading to different rooms. This was to confuse grave robbers about which passage to take. Sometimes relatives, such as the queen, were buried in the extra rooms. Tombs were supposed to be the palaces of pharaohs in the afterlife. Mourners filled the tomb with objects ranging from food to furniture that the mummified pharaoh would need. Some tombs contained small statues that were supposed to be servants for the dead person. Egyptian artists decorated royal tombs with wall paintings and sculptures carved into the walls. Art was meant to glorify both the gods and the dead person. A sculpture of a dead pharaoh had âperfectâ features, no matter how he really looked. Artists also followed strict rules about how to portray humans. Paintings showed a personâs head, arms, and legs from the side. They showed the front of the body from the neck down to the waist. Wall paintings showed pharaohs enjoying themselves so they could have a happy afterlife. One favorite scene was of the pharaoh fishing in a papyrus marsh. Warlike kings were often portrayed in battle. Scenes might also show people providing for the needs of the dead person. Such activities included growing and preparing food, caring for animals, and building boats. As hard as the pharaohs tried to hide themselves, robbers stole the treasures from almost every tomb. Only a secret tomb built for a New Kingdom pharaoh was ever found with much of its treasure untouched. The dazzling riches found in this tomb show how much wealth the pharaohs spent preparing for the afterlife. By about 2130 B.C., Egyptian kings began to lose their power to local rulers of the provinces. For about 500 more years, the kings held Egypt together, but with a much weaker central government. This period of Egyptian history is called the Middle Kingdom. Rulers during the Middle Kingdom also faced challenges from outside Egypt. A nomadic people called the Hyksos invaded Egypt from the northeast. Their army conquered by using better weapons and horse-drawn chariots, which were new to Egyptians. After about 100 years, the Egyptians drove out the Hyksos and began the New Kingdom.'}

The study will deepen the knowledge of the relationship between digital connectivity infrastructure and the indigenous community. It also provides ideas and suggestions for a design solution for improving the current conditions in the assigned township, Borroloola, Northern Territory. Digital Infrastructure Challenges that faced by Orange Asli Community in Malaysia In the past few decades, researchers have been working hard to find ways to overcome the digital infrastructure challenges faced by Indigenous communities, Orang Asli, the first nation people in the Malay peninsula. The indigenous communities in Malaysia have telecentres, internet connections and all essential information communication technologies. However, the provision of digital infrastructure only âcures the symptoms but not the diseaseâ. A study conducted by Bala. P and Tan. CE. (2021) has explored and researched four Orang Asli communitiesâ telecentres and found that the underlying issue with digital infrastructure in the indigenous community is the lack of emergency technical support, lack of guidance and guidelines in solving critical technical issues and lack of training for indigenous people to learn new ICT equipment and perform tasks. I agree that Tan stated providing the infrastructure will only solve the surface issues but not the inner problem. Hence, it might need a remote management system to overcome challenges and adapt community's evolving needs. Distance education challenges that faced by Indigenous Community in Canada Education is essential for every community, including both indigenous and non- indigenous communities. Every Individual has the right to a quality education. It educates individuals and helps to develop skills. For remote indigenous communities, digital distance education is the best way to help the indigenous student learn without the restriction of geography. Yet, some challenges need to be addressed. A research report prepared by Leask (as cited in OâDonnell S et al., 2016) from Natuashish in Labrador studied the digital technologies in community 101231636 Research Report 4 schools and found that the lack of network connectivity heavily impacts the progress of digital distance education in the remote indigenous community. The unstable and slow connection makes specific education programs unavailable such as cloud library services, attendance-taking tools and any interactive-based websites. Besides, the lack of technology devices in the indigenous community compared to the technology-filled community schools is also a factor that aggravated the distance education challenges and quality of education. Healthcare and Telehealth challenges that faced by Indigenous community in Canada Health plays a vital role in every community, especially the indigenous community. As the Indigenous community is far from the urban area, access to health care services will be limited. Hence, telehealth was introduced to communities and used as the primary healthcare service across Indigenous communities. Telehealth is a service that uses telecommunication networks to provide remote health support by phone call or video call. However, there are some underlying challenges that telehealth needs to encounter. Several researchers (as cited in OâDonnell S et al., 2016) have documented a survey study on the perception of telemental health in two remote indigenous communities in Canada. The outcome of research shows that most Indigenous people have difficulties contacting external mental health workers. They are also having challenges in obtaining mental healthcare from their community. The reason behind this is that the telecommunication networks are not stable and constantly being out of range. Furthermore, the telehealth service must occur in the community health centre, making delivering mental health services more challenging. Challenges to ensuring public access and preservation ancient wisdom to Indigenous information in Africa Africa is a long historical standing country with much indigenous cultural heritage and ancient wisdom. But the preservation of cultural heritage such as languages, astrology, and agriculture knowledge is poor and faces challenging issues. A study conducted by Moseti and Mutula (as cited by Chowdhury. G et al.) in the Indigenous community in Kenya observed the lack of ICT infrastructure, ICT policies 101231636 Research Report 5 and standards, funding, and basic network infrastructures are the key to poor use of institutional repositories. Nevertheless, the issues in digital infrastructure in the indigenous community also bring up the concern of accessing digital information. Few researchers (as cited by Chowdhury. G et al.) argue that the supply of telecentres in Africa has remained slow and hardly maintains the basic needs. Results show that the high cost of internet access is a significant barrier for rural indigenous communities to access digital information. 1.1 Methodology A qualitative two-stage methodology has been used in this literature review. The first stage of review is using the Historical Model, which is searching for the past ten years of a relevant event, report, government conference and journal that study about digital communication infrastructure challenges faced by the worldwide indigenous community, especially in finding the relation between inherent challenges and digital infrastructure in each indigenous community. The second stage of the review will use the Grounded Theory Method, which focuses on gathering and analysing essential information found in the first stage of research. It is to understand specific challenges that each indigenous community faces. 2 Project background This project will focus on one of the Australian Indigenous communities, Borroloola, Northern Territory, in researching and discussing the current state of digital connectivity infrastructure in the community. It also analyses the current challenges and demands of information communication technologies and services in Borroloola. 1.0 Project Description In this modern era, the convergence of information communication and computing technologies has rapidly developed. It has become essential in driving social development, including socio-economy, education, health and more. Digital infrastructure, as the backbone of digital technology, should also be given much attention to ensure service 101231636 Research Report 6 availability. A few decades later, the Australian government found that the digital divide between the urban area and indigenous community has been gradually expanded, which might lead to negative impacts such as technology discrimination. All Indigenous communities, especially the Indigenous community, Borroloola, which reside in Northern Territory, should have access to the same digital opportunity as other states. 1.2 Problem Statement Borroloola is a remote community town in the Northern Territory of Australia, with under 1000 villagers. It faces many challenges in accessing and obtaining digital communication services. In general, Northern Territory has a vast territory and a highly dispersed population, which creates challenges in health, education, and telecommunications. Specifically, the Borroloola community faced accommodation issues in which no electricity or water was provided. A media report from Ryan. H (2019) has reported that aboriginal people live in harsh accommodations and environments, where houses lack basic amenities, there is the disrepair of accommodation and overcrowded residents. These issues will lead indigenous people to poor service accessibility, including telecommunication. Nevertheless, overcrowding has also led to sickness, and the spread of any disease will be rapid and deadly. The poor plumbing and sewerage in the Indigenous community will also potentially result in water pollution. Hence, there is an urgent need for digital technology services and communication technologies in the community. 101231636 Research Report 7 2 Project Goals and Objectives The goal of this project is to focus on the Indigenous community, Borroloola, Northern Territory, with their digital communication infrastructure needs. Project will be in line with telecommunications principles which consider Appropriateness, Affordability, Access and equity, Environmental health, Health and safety and Sustainable livelihoods. The first stage of goals will be researching Indigenous digital literacy, user accessibility, and affordability in the Borroloola community related to the communication infrastructure. Objectives will be examined the Indigenous community's access to digital communication technology in daily activities. Also, guarantee that essential application used in the Indigenous community is affordable and digitally literate. The second stage of goals will be examined current difficulties faced by the Indigenous community, explore the demand for communication technologies, and the needs for remote Indigenous communication services. The objectives of this goal will be to compare the population of Borroloola communities with communication coverage. Estimating overall capital needs for digital communication infrastructure in Borroloola. 3 Desired outcomes and benefits The desired outcomes and benefits for this project is improve the quality of life for Indigenous community by introduce and strengthen the digital communication infrastructure. It helps to improve health, education, transportation, socio-economy, and pollution issues in Borroloola community. 101231636 Research Report 8 4 Learning issue/problem The learning issue I choose is the need for telehealth in the Borroloola community in relation to communication infrastructure and service. In the rural Indigenous area in Northern Territory, access to medical services is not as easy as people living in urban areas. They have travelled hundreds of kilometers to find a hospital. According to the Department of Health in Northern Territory (2015), in researching the uptake of telehealth in Indigenous townships including Alice Springs, Katherine, Tennant Creek, Borroloola Northern Territory and more between 2013/2014 and 2014/2015. Research shows that about 231% growth for patients and providers end in telehealth utilization. Based on the above statistics, we can assume that Borroloola Indigenous community require more telehealth services and is willing to accept the telehealth service offered by the government. However, the poor network connections might lead to service interruption and hinder telehealth growth in Northern Territory. A survey prepared by the Department of Health in Northern Territory (2015) and sent to clinicians who provide telehealth in NT shows that around 85% response says the telehealth service provides better service. But several clinicians also give feedback on bad connectivity. For example, in Central Australia, NT, the network infrastructure has experienced high bandwidth collapses or congestion and cannot get a reliable connection for daily basic needs, even telehealth. Australia Bureau of Statistics (as cited in Murtagh.D et al. 2017) stated that remote indigenous communities tend to have insufficient Internet speed, which makes the video type of conferencing services not reliable. Furthermore, Aboriginal Medical Services Alliance NT (as cited in Murtagh.D et al. 2017) also claimed that although some health centres in NT in 2015 had satellite quality for telehealth, none of them had adequate bandwidth to maintain a stable and quality line connection. Most of the bandwidth is reserved for accessing database clinical information systems and overlooked videoconferencing, which is the primary part of telehealth. In the same context, the digital communication infrastructure in Borroloola township might also face low bandwidth network connection issues. 101231636 Research Report 9 5 Project Scope and Exclusions The project scope of the whole project will be analyzed challenges faced by Borroloola regarding communication technologies and propose digital infrastructure solutions to address them. The project in scope will be finding six different learning issues in Borroloola, prioritizing the top four learning issues and offering digital connectivity infrastructure solutions. The out scope of the project will be actual implementation and deploy the solution proposal, as it must go through government consideration and involve many entities to collaborate with precise calculation. 6 Project Deliverables The project deliverables will be a final business case report which provide current challenges and learning issues of Borroloola community, along with the recommended solution proposed. 7 Project Management Plan 7.1 Timeline Digital Connectivity Infrastructure for Remote Indigenous Communications Week 6 Week 7 Week 8 Week 9 Week 10 Week 11 Week 12 Design and finalize design model Develop and evaluate prototype Testing prototype and redesign Table 1: Project Timeline 101231636 Research Report 10 7.2 Goals and Milestones Goal: Design and finalize the design model Milestone: Complete the research report and get feedback from the tutor Milestone: Design prototype with team members.

        self.jsonobj3 = {"submissionId" : "100072", "extractedText" : "Introduction: The boom in technological advancements over the past 4 to 5 decades has led to an influx of electronic devices that helped to improve the lives of many. Technological breakthroughs such as microprocessors, light emitting diodes (LED), and lithium-ion batteries, they are almost to be found everywhere in our modern-day consumer electronics: TVs, speakers, displays, computers, lighting, and many more. In this information era, it is almost impossible for us to carry out our day-to-day routines without relying on consumer electronics. According to Ambaye (2020), the demand for rare earth materials has increased significantly over the years because of their extensive use [1], with the commonly sourced being praseodymium, cerium, lanthanum, neodymium, samarium, and gadolinium due to their abundance throughout the globe. This also led to an increase in areas around the world being converted to rare earth mining spots. Context Rare earth materialsâ impact towards humans According to Liangâs (2018) investigation, the increase in residual materials that were discarded, and the pollution caused by them in the environment has led to essence of the materials being present in the human body through the food chain [2]. Zhang (2014) evaluated the reproductive toxicity of Sm (Samarium) in testicular lesions of male ICR mice given a continuous oral administration of Sm nitrate for 90 days. They found that the Sm targeted the testis because it showed a decrease in testicular sperm and spermatogenic cells [3]. All of which sounds dangerous, but it can be under control if traces of material residue are out of reach from civilisation. Research carried out by Liang (2018) found that children that are studying near the Bayan Obo mining area have traces of rare earth elements in their urine samples, so as the adults working or living near the mine. Even though the research did not find a link between the exposure of rare earth materials in drinking water and the health of the nearby residents, it is still mind boggling that organizations did not take any action to prevent or cure health issues that arise during material extraction. Furthermore, Figure 1: Donut 4 | P age according to Kantâs principle of consistency, if every tech organization allows its employees to risk catching infections or long-term health damage for the sake of meeting demands, more and more people are going to get infected. Based on the act of Utilitarianism, it is considered as unethical because the end results in more harming than happiness to the group. It is also unethical based on Kantâs principle of Interaction because organizations sacrificed their workerâs and public health over their own interests, profits. Rare earth materials polluting the environment The extensive use of rare earth elements can potentially lead to severe contamination of the surrounding environment. This includes agriculture, aquatic life, and soil, which can directly or indirectly affect the public health. According to Kyung (2016), he found 5 | P age the damage done by rare earth mining towards nature including organ and general body defects to animals, and growth inhibition and a reduction of chlorophyll production in plants. He also questioned the high demand for rare earth materials in several applications, yet very little information on its effects on human health and the environment [4]. This question alone already shows that organizations are not concerned about the public health, regardless of if they are aware about this issue or not. Weng (2013) stated that the deposit types of the rare earth materials can influence environmental effects, and that materials with radioactive properties in ores is the most common concern [5]. According to the Act of Utilitarianism, the organizations are unethical because the ignorance or the lack of prevention nor cure will harm not only their clients, but also the general public. This also unethical according to the Rule of Utilitarianism and Kantâs Rule of Universality because the pollution caused by organization not only shows that they are irresponsible, but it also caused harm towards public health. Who to blame? China? Barakos (2016) stated that despite the spur in exploration activities, the global production of rare earth materials remains small, and majority of the operations are still based in China [6]. That statement was 6 years old; China is not the only country that is guilty of excessive mining but is still considered notorious in the rare earth industry. Harvard International Review stated that Chinaâs dominance over the rare earth industry was only because they cut corners by laxing environmental regulations, usage of low cost and high pollution methods. However, without Chinaâs corner cutting strategies, consumers all around the world might not be able to purchase their devices at an affordable price. So, who is there to blame, the consumers demanding for affordable devices, the organizations that mishandle the sourcing, or China with its laxed pollution enforcement to meet consumer demand? Ethical Recommendation Based on the context stated above, it is not ethical to source rare earth materials used as components in high-technology devices. This is because organizations and countries are competing for rare earth extraction to meet demands, which eventually led to sacrifices to public and environmental health. Organizations can extend their support towards their legacy devices. The extended support for legacy devices meant that consumers could maximize the usage of their devices and without worrying about it becoming useless or obsolete. However, organizations continue to provide support for legacy devices, which means they still have to allocate some of their costs for tooling, knowledge, and blueprints, which will reduce their revenues. According to the Act of Altruism, this is considered ethical because organizations made the lives of its customers easier even if it meant losing some profits. Organizations can also incorporate or replace rare earth materials with something renewable or recyclable. By doing so, less rare earth materials are required to be 6 | P age sourced and extracted as their demands slowly decreases in favour of recycled or renewable materials. Organizations can also save a fortune in their development costs in the long run as rare earth materials will continue to deplete and prices will eventually skyrocket. Manufacturers can start by slowly phase out the usage of rare earth materials and incorporate some renewable or recycled materials into their components (aluminium, plastic). At the very least, manufacturers can try to reduce the usage of rare earth materials in their products by re-engineering them to be smaller and more compact without sacrificing performance. In other words, it does not need to be bulkier that it needs to be. Both recommendations are also considered ethical according to Kantâs principle of consistency. This is because if every organization extends their support for legacy devices and to use renewable materials for new devices, this could mean a significant reduction in rare earth materials usage. This also results in a cleaner environment and lesser risk of toxic waste exposure to the public. This also obeys Kantâs rule of Universality as these solutions would prove that the organizations are responsible as they change their ways of doing. Conclusion Based on the ethical dilemmas and explanations stated above, the act of sourcing rare earth materials is unanimously viewed by various research as unethical; corner cutting and improper disposal of rare earth sourcing all for the sake of meeting demands for a quick profit. The goal here is not to condemn the organizations that sourced rare earth materials, but to suggest alternatives that are somewhat more ethical that what they are currently doing so that they could produce lesser environmental and health impacts without affecting their business.

        self.assertEqual(self.element.extractedText, "The Greek historian knew what he was talking about. The Nile River fed Egyptian civilization for hundreds of years. The Longest River the Nile is 4,160 miles long-the worldâs longest river. It begins near the equator in Africa and flows north to the Mediterranean Sea. In the south the Nile churns with cataracts. A cataract is a waterfall. Near the sea the Nile branches into a delta. A delta is an area near a riverâs mouth where the water deposits fine soil called silt. In the delta, the Nile divides into many streams. The river is called the upper Nile in the south and the lower Nile in the north. For centuries, heavy rains in Ethiopia caused the Nile to flood every summer. The floods deposited rich soil along the Nileâs shores. This soil was fertile, which means it was good for growing crops. Unlike the Tigris and Euphrates, the Nile River flooded at the same time every year, so farmers could predict when to plant their crops. Red Land, Black Land The ancient Egyptians lived in narrow bands of land on each side of the Nile. They called this region the black land because of the fertile soil that the floods deposited. The red land was the barren desert beyond the fertile region. Weather in Egypt was almost always the same. Eight months of the year were sunny and hot. The four months of winter were sunny but cooler. Most of the region received only an inch of rain a year. The parts of Egypt not near the Nile were a desert. Isolation The harsh desert acted as a barrier to keep out enemies. The Mediterranean coast was swampy and lacked good harbors. For these reasons, early Egyptians stayed close to home. Each year, Egyptian farmers watched for white birds called ibises, which flew up from the south. When the birds arrived, the annual flood waters would soon follow. After the waters drained away, farmers could plant seeds in the fertile soil. Agricultural Techniques By about 2400 B.C., farmers used technology to expand their farmland. Working together, they dug irrigation canals that carried river water to dry areas. Then they used a tool called a shaduf to spread the water across the fields. These innovative, or new, techniques gave them more farmland. Egyptian Crops Ancient Egyptians grew a large variety of foods. They were the first to grind wheat into flour and to mix the flour with yeast and water to make dough rise into bread. They grew vegetables such as lettuce, radishes, asparagus, and cucumbers. Fruits included dates, figs, grapes, and watermelons. Egyptians also grew the materials for their clothes. They were the first to weave fibers from flax plants into a fabric called linen. Lightweight linen cloth was perfect for hot Egyptian days. Men wore linen wraps around their waists. Women wore loose, sleeveless dresses. Egyptians also wove marsh grasses into sandals. Egyptian Houses Egyptians built houses using bricks made of mud from the Nile mixed with chopped straw. They placed narrow windows high in the walls to reduce bright sunlight. Egyptians often painted walls white to reflect the blazing heat. They wove sticks and palm trees to make roofs. Inside, woven reed mats covered the dirt floor. Most Egyptians slept on mats covered with linen sheets. Wealthy citizens enjoyed bed frames and cushions. Egyptian nobles had fancier homes with tree-lined courtyards for shade. Some had a pool filled with lotus blossoms and fish. Poorer Egyptians simply went to the roof to cool off after sunset. They often cooked, ate, and even slept outside. Egyptâs economy depended on farming. However, the natural resources of the area allowed other economic activities to develop too. The Egyptians wanted valuable metals that were not found in the black land. For example, they wanted copper to make tools and weapons. Egyptians looked for copper as early as 6000 B.C. Later they learned that iron was stronger, and they sought it as well. Ancient Egyptians also desired gold for its bright beauty. The Egyptian word for gold was nub. Nubia was the Egyptian name for the area of the upper Nile that had the richest gold mines in Africa. Mining minerals was difficult. Veins (long streaks) of copper, iron, and bronze were hidden inside desert mountains in the hot Sinai Peninsula, east of Egypt. Even during the cool season, chipping minerals out of the rock was miserable work. Egyptians mined precious stones too. They were probably the first people in the world to mine turquoise. The Egyptians also mined lapis lazuli. These beautiful blue stones were used in jewelry.The Nile had fish and other wildlife that Egyptians wanted. To go on the river, Egyptians made lightweight rafts by binding together reeds. They used everything from nets to harpoons to catch fish. One ancient painting even shows a man ready to hit a catfish with a wooden hammer. More adventurous hunters speared hippopotamuses and crocodiles along the Nile. Egyptians also captured quail with nets. They used boomerangs to knock down flying ducks and geese. (A boomerang is a curved stick that returns to the person who threw it.) Eventually, Egyptians equipped their reed boats with sails and oars. The Nile then became a highway. The riverâs current was slow, so boaters used paddles to go faster when they traveled north with the current. Going south, they raised a sail and let the winds that blew in that direction push them. The Nile provided so well for Egyptians that sometimes they had surpluses, or more goods than they needed. They began to trade with each other. Ancient Egypt had no money, so people exchanged goods that they grew or made. This method of trade is called bartering. Egypt prospered along the Nile. This prosperity made life easier and provided greater opportunities for many Egyptians. When farmers produce food surpluses, the societyâs economy begins to expand. Cities emerge as centers of culture and power, and people learn to do jobs that do not involve agriculture. For example, some ancient Egyptians learned to be scribes, people whose job was to write and keep records. As Egyptian civilization grew more complex, people took on jobs other than that of a farmer or scribe. Some skilled artisans erected stone or brick houses and temples. Other artisans made pottery, incense, mats, furniture, linen clothing, sandals, or jewelry. A few Egyptians traveled to the upper Nile to trade with other Africans. These traders took Egyptian products such as scrolls, linen, gold, and jewelry. They brought back exotic woods, animal skins, and live beasts. As Egypt grew, so did its need to organize. Egyptians created a government that divided the empire into 42 provinces. Many officials worked to keep the provinces running smoothly. Egypt also created an army to defend itself. One of the highest jobs in Egypt was to be a priest. Priests followed formal rituals and took care of the temples. Before entering a temple, a priest bathed and put on special linen garments and white sandals. Priests cleaned the sacred statues in temples, changed their clothes, and even fed them meals. Together, the priests and the ruler held ceremonies to please the gods. Egyptians believed that if the gods were angry, the Nile would not flood. As a result, crops would not grow, and people would die. So the ruler and the priests tried hard to keep the gods happy. By doing so, they hoped to maintain the social and political order. Slaves were at the bottom of society. In Egypt, people became slaves if they owed a debt, committed a crime, or were captured in war. Egyptian slaves were usually freed after a period of time. One exception was the slaves who had to work in the mines. Many died from the exhausting labor. Egypt was one of the best places in the ancient world to be a woman. Unlike other ancient African cultures, in Egyptian society men and women had fairly equal rights. For example, they could both own and manage their own property. The main job of most women was to care for their children and home, but some did other jobs too. Some women wove cloth. Others worked with their husbands in fields or workshops. Some women, such as Queen Tiy, even rose to important positions in the government. Children in Egypt played with toys such as dolls, animal figures, board games, and marbles. Their parents made the toys from wood or clay. Boys and girls also played rough physical games with balls made of leather or reeds. Boys and some girls from wealthy families went to schools run by scribes or priests. Most other children learned their parentsâ jobs. Almost all Egyptians married when they were in their early teens. As in many ancient societies, much of the knowledge of Egypt came about as priests studied the world to find ways to please the gods. Other advances came about because of practical discoveries. Egyptian priests studied the sky as part of their religion. About 5,000 years ago, they noticed that a star now called Sirius appeared shortly before the Nile began to flood. The star returned to the same position in 365 days. Based on that, Egyptians developed the worldâs first practical calendar. The Egyptians developed some of the first geometry. Each year the Nileâs floods washed away land boundaries. To restore property lines, surveyors measured the land by using ropes that were knotted at regular intervals. Geometric shapes such as squares and triangles were sacred to Egyptians. Architects used them in the design of royal temples and monuments. Egyptian doctors often prepared dead bodies for burial, so they knew the parts of the body. That knowledge helped them perform some of the worldâs first surgery. Some doctors specialized in using medicines made of herbs. Egyptian medicine was far from perfect. Doctors believed that the heart controlled thought and the brain circulated blood, which is the opposite of what is known now. Some Egyptian treatments would raise eyebrows today. One âcureâ for an upset stomach was to eat a hogâs tooth crushed inside sugar cakes! Beginning about 3000 B.C., Egyptians developed a writing system using hieroglyphs. Hieroglyphs Hieroglyphs are pictures that stand for different words or sounds. Early Egyptians created a hieroglyphic system with about 700 characters. Over time the system grew to include more than 6,000 symbols. The Egyptians also developed a paperlike material called papyrus papyrus from a reed of the same name. Egyptians cut the stems into strips, pressed them, and dried them into sheets that could be rolled into scrolls. Papyrus scrolls were light and easy to carry. With them, Egyptians created some of the first books. Legend says a king named Narmer united Upper and Lower Egypt. Some historians think Narmer actually represents several kings who gradually joined the two lands. After Egypt was united, its ruler wore the Double Crown. It combined the red Crown of Lower Egypt with the white Crown of Upper Egypt. The first dynasty of the Egyptian empire began about 2925 B.C. A dynasty is a line of rulers from the same family. When a king died, one of his children usually took his place as ruler. The order in which members of a royal family inherit a throne is called the succession. More than 30 dynasties ruled ancient Egypt. Historians divide ancient Egyptian dynasties into the Old Kingdom, the Middle Kingdom, and the New Kingdom. The Old Kingdom started about 2575 B.C., when the Egyptian empire was gaining strength. The king of Egypt became known as the pharaoh pharaoh. The word pharaoh meant âgreat house,â and it was originally used to describe the kingâs palace. Later it became the title of the king himself. The pharaoh ruled from the capital city of Memphis. The ancient Egyptians thought the pharaoh was a child of the gods and a god himself. Egyptians believed that if the pharaoh and his subjects honored the gods, their lives would be happy. If Egypt suffered hard times for a long period, the people blamed the pharaoh for angering the gods. In such a case, a rival might drive him from power and start a new dynasty. Because the pharaoh was thought to be a god, government and religion were not separate in ancient Egypt. Priests had much power in the government. Many high officials were priests. The first rulers of Egypt were often buried in an underground tomb topped by mud brick. Soon, kings wanted more permanent monuments. They replaced the mud brick with a small pyramid of brick or stone. A pyramid is a structure shaped like a triangle, with four sides that meet at a point. About 2630 B.C., King Djoser built a much larger pyramid over his tomb. It is called a step pyramid because its sides rise in a series of giant steps. It is the oldest-known large stone structure in the world. About 80 years later, a pharaoh named Khufu decided he wanted a monument that would show the world how great he was. He ordered the construction of the largest pyramid ever built. Along its base, each side was about 760 feet long. The core was built from 2.3 million blocks of stone. Building the Great Pyramid was hard work. Miners cut the huge blocks of stone using copper saws and chisels. These tools were much softer than the iron tools developed later. Other teams of workers pulled the stone slabs up long, sloping ramps to their place on the pyramid. Near the top of the pyramid, the ramps ended. Workers dragged each heavy block hundreds of feet and then set it in place. Farmers did the heavy labor of hauling stone during the season when the Nile flooded their fields. Skilled stonecutters and overseers worked year-round. The Great Pyramid took nearly 20 years to build. An estimated 20,000 Egyptians worked on it. A city called Giza was built for the pyramid workers and the people who fed, clothed, and housed them. Eventually, Egyptians stopped building pyramids. One reason is that the pyramids drew attention to the tombs inside them. Grave robbers broke into the tombs to steal the treasure buried with the pharaohs. Sometimes they also stole the mummies. Egyptians believed that if a tomb was robbed, the person buried there could not have a happy afterlife. During the New Kingdom, pharaohs began building more secret tombs in an area called the Valley of the Kings. The burial chambers were hidden in mountains near the Nile. This way, the pharaohs hoped to protect their bodies and treasures from robbers. Both the pyramids and later tombs had several passageways leading to different rooms. This was to confuse grave robbers about which passage to take. Sometimes relatives, such as the queen, were buried in the extra rooms. Tombs were supposed to be the palaces of pharaohs in the afterlife. Mourners filled the tomb with objects ranging from food to furniture that the mummified pharaoh would need. Some tombs contained small statues that were supposed to be servants for the dead person. Egyptian artists decorated royal tombs with wall paintings and sculptures carved into the walls. Art was meant to glorify both the gods and the dead person. A sculpture of a dead pharaoh had âperfectâ features, no matter how he really looked. Artists also followed strict rules about how to portray humans. Paintings showed a personâs head, arms, and legs from the side. They showed the front of the body from the neck down to the waist. Wall paintings showed pharaohs enjoying themselves so they could have a happy afterlife. One favorite scene was of the pharaoh fishing in a papyrus marsh. Warlike kings were often portrayed in battle. Scenes might also show people providing for the needs of the dead person. Such activities included growing and preparing food, caring for animals, and building boats. As hard as the pharaohs tried to hide themselves, robbers stole the treasures from almost every tomb. Only a secret tomb built for a New Kingdom pharaoh was ever found with much of its treasure untouched. The dazzling riches found in this tomb show how much wealth the pharaohs spent preparing for the afterlife. By about 2130 B.C., Egyptian kings began to lose their power to local rulers of the provinces. For about 500 more years, the kings held Egypt together, but with a much weaker central government. This period of Egyptian history is called the Middle Kingdom. Rulers during the Middle Kingdom also faced challenges from outside Egypt. A nomadic people called the Hyksos invaded Egypt from the northeast. Their army conquered by using better weapons and horse-drawn chariots, which were new to Egyptians. After about 100 years, the Egyptians drove out the Hyksos and began the New Kingdom.")

The study will deepen the knowledge of the relationship between digital connectivity infrastructure and the indigenous community. It also provides ideas and suggestions for a design solution for improving the current conditions in the assigned township, Borroloola, Northern Territory. Digital Infrastructure Challenges that faced by Orange Asli Community in Malaysia In the past few decades, researchers have been working hard to find ways to overcome the digital infrastructure challenges faced by Indigenous communities, Orang Asli, the first nation people in the Malay peninsula. The indigenous communities in Malaysia have telecentres, internet connections and all essential information communication technologies. However, the provision of digital infrastructure only âcures the symptoms but not the diseaseâ. A study conducted by Bala. P and Tan. CE. (2021) has explored and researched four Orang Asli communitiesâ telecentres and found that the underlying issue with digital infrastructure in the indigenous community is the lack of emergency technical support, lack of guidance and guidelines in solving critical technical issues and lack of training for indigenous people to learn new ICT equipment and perform tasks. I agree that Tan stated providing the infrastructure will only solve the surface issues but not the inner problem. Hence, it might need a remote management system to overcome challenges and adapt community's evolving needs. Distance education challenges that faced by Indigenous Community in Canada Education is essential for every community, including both indigenous and non- indigenous communities. Every Individual has the right to a quality education. It educates individuals and helps to develop skills. For remote indigenous communities, digital distance education is the best way to help the indigenous student learn without the restriction of geography. Yet, some challenges need to be addressed. A research report prepared by Leask (as cited in OâDonnell S et al., 2016) from Natuashish in Labrador studied the digital technologies in community 101231636 Research Report 4 schools and found that the lack of network connectivity heavily impacts the progress of digital distance education in the remote indigenous community. The unstable and slow connection makes specific education programs unavailable such as cloud library services, attendance-taking tools and any interactive-based websites. Besides, the lack of technology devices in the indigenous community compared to the technology-filled community schools is also a factor that aggravated the distance education challenges and quality of education. Healthcare and Telehealth challenges that faced by Indigenous community in Canada Health plays a vital role in every community, especially the indigenous community. As the Indigenous community is far from the urban area, access to health care services will be limited. Hence, telehealth was introduced to communities and used as the primary healthcare service across Indigenous communities. Telehealth is a service that uses telecommunication networks to provide remote health support by phone call or video call. However, there are some underlying challenges that telehealth needs to encounter. Several researchers (as cited in OâDonnell S et al., 2016) have documented a survey study on the perception of telemental health in two remote indigenous communities in Canada. The outcome of research shows that most Indigenous people have difficulties contacting external mental health workers. They are also having challenges in obtaining mental healthcare from their community. The reason behind this is that the telecommunication networks are not stable and constantly being out of range. Furthermore, the telehealth service must occur in the community health centre, making delivering mental health services more challenging. Challenges to ensuring public access and preservation ancient wisdom to Indigenous information in Africa Africa is a long historical standing country with much indigenous cultural heritage and ancient wisdom. But the preservation of cultural heritage such as languages, astrology, and agriculture knowledge is poor and faces challenging issues. A study conducted by Moseti and Mutula (as cited by Chowdhury. G et al.) in the Indigenous community in Kenya observed the lack of ICT infrastructure, ICT policies 101231636 Research Report 5 and standards, funding, and basic network infrastructures are the key to poor use of institutional repositories. Nevertheless, the issues in digital infrastructure in the indigenous community also bring up the concern of accessing digital information. Few researchers (as cited by Chowdhury. G et al.) argue that the supply of telecentres in Africa has remained slow and hardly maintains the basic needs. Results show that the high cost of internet access is a significant barrier for rural indigenous communities to access digital information. 1.1 Methodology A qualitative two-stage methodology has been used in this literature review. The first stage of review is using the Historical Model, which is searching for the past ten years of a relevant event, report, government conference and journal that study about digital communication infrastructure challenges faced by the worldwide indigenous community, especially in finding the relation between inherent challenges and digital infrastructure in each indigenous community. The second stage of the review will use the Grounded Theory Method, which focuses on gathering and analysing essential information found in the first stage of research. It is to understand specific challenges that each indigenous community faces. 2 Project background This project will focus on one of the Australian Indigenous communities, Borroloola, Northern Territory, in researching and discussing the current state of digital connectivity infrastructure in the community. It also analyses the current challenges and demands of information communication technologies and services in Borroloola. 1.0 Project Description In this modern era, the convergence of information communication and computing technologies has rapidly developed. It has become essential in driving social development, including socio-economy, education, health and more. Digital infrastructure, as the backbone of digital technology, should also be given much attention to ensure service 101231636 Research Report 6 availability. A few decades later, the Australian government found that the digital divide between the urban area and indigenous community has been gradually expanded, which might lead to negative impacts such as technology discrimination. All Indigenous communities, especially the Indigenous community, Borroloola, which reside in Northern Territory, should have access to the same digital opportunity as other states. 1.2 Problem Statement Borroloola is a remote community town in the Northern Territory of Australia, with under 1000 villagers. It faces many challenges in accessing and obtaining digital communication services. In general, Northern Territory has a vast territory and a highly dispersed population, which creates challenges in health, education, and telecommunications. Specifically, the Borroloola community faced accommodation issues in which no electricity or water was provided. A media report from Ryan. H (2019) has reported that aboriginal people live in harsh accommodations and environments, where houses lack basic amenities, there is the disrepair of accommodation and overcrowded residents. These issues will lead indigenous people to poor service accessibility, including telecommunication. Nevertheless, overcrowding has also led to sickness, and the spread of any disease will be rapid and deadly. The poor plumbing and sewerage in the Indigenous community will also potentially result in water pollution. Hence, there is an urgent need for digital technology services and communication technologies in the community. 101231636 Research Report 7 2 Project Goals and Objectives The goal of this project is to focus on the Indigenous community, Borroloola, Northern Territory, with their digital communication infrastructure needs. Project will be in line with telecommunications principles which consider Appropriateness, Affordability, Access and equity, Environmental health, Health and safety and Sustainable livelihoods. The first stage of goals will be researching Indigenous digital literacy, user accessibility, and affordability in the Borroloola community related to the communication infrastructure. Objectives will be examined the Indigenous community's access to digital communication technology in daily activities. Also, guarantee that essential application used in the Indigenous community is affordable and digitally literate. The second stage of goals will be examined current difficulties faced by the Indigenous community, explore the demand for communication technologies, and the needs for remote Indigenous communication services. The objectives of this goal will be to compare the population of Borroloola communities with communication coverage. Estimating overall capital needs for digital communication infrastructure in Borroloola. 3 Desired outcomes and benefits The desired outcomes and benefits for this project is improve the quality of life for Indigenous community by introduce and strengthen the digital communication infrastructure. It helps to improve health, education, transportation, socio-economy, and pollution issues in Borroloola community. 101231636 Research Report 8 4 Learning issue/problem The learning issue I choose is the need for telehealth in the Borroloola community in relation to communication infrastructure and service. In the rural Indigenous area in Northern Territory, access to medical services is not as easy as people living in urban areas. They have travelled hundreds of kilometers to find a hospital. According to the Department of Health in Northern Territory (2015), in researching the uptake of telehealth in Indigenous townships including Alice Springs, Katherine, Tennant Creek, Borroloola Northern Territory and more between 2013/2014 and 2014/2015. Research shows that about 231% growth for patients and providers end in telehealth utilization. Based on the above statistics, we can assume that Borroloola Indigenous community require more telehealth services and is willing to accept the telehealth service offered by the government. However, the poor network connections might lead to service interruption and hinder telehealth growth in Northern Territory. A survey prepared by the Department of Health in Northern Territory (2015) and sent to clinicians who provide telehealth in NT shows that around 85% response says the telehealth service provides better service. But several clinicians also give feedback on bad connectivity. For example, in Central Australia, NT, the network infrastructure has experienced high bandwidth collapses or congestion and cannot get a reliable connection for daily basic needs, even telehealth. Australia Bureau of Statistics (as cited in Murtagh.D et al. 2017) stated that remote indigenous communities tend to have insufficient Internet speed, which makes the video type of conferencing services not reliable. Furthermore, Aboriginal Medical Services Alliance NT (as cited in Murtagh.D et al. 2017) also claimed that although some health centres in NT in 2015 had satellite quality for telehealth, none of them had adequate bandwidth to maintain a stable and quality line connection. Most of the bandwidth is reserved for accessing database clinical information systems and overlooked videoconferencing, which is the primary part of telehealth. In the same context, the digital communication infrastructure in Borroloola township might also face low bandwidth network connection issues. 101231636 Research Report 9 5 Project Scope and Exclusions The project scope of the whole project will be analyzed challenges faced by Borroloola regarding communication technologies and propose digital infrastructure solutions to address them. The project in scope will be finding six different learning issues in Borroloola, prioritizing the top four learning issues and offering digital connectivity infrastructure solutions. The out scope of the project will be actual implementation and deploy the solution proposal, as it must go through government consideration and involve many entities to collaborate with precise calculation. 6 Project Deliverables The project deliverables will be a final business case report which provide current challenges and learning issues of Borroloola community, along with the recommended solution proposed. 7 Project Management Plan 7.1 Timeline Digital Connectivity Infrastructure for Remote Indigenous Communications Week 6 Week 7 Week 8 Week 9 Week 10 Week 11 Week 12 Design and finalize design model Develop and evaluate prototype Testing prototype and redesign Table 1: Project Timeline 101231636 Research Report 10 7.2 Goals and Milestones Goal: Design and finalize the design model Milestone: Complete the research report and get feedback from the tutor Milestone: Design prototype with team members.

        self.assertEqual (self.element3.extractedText, "Introduction: The boom in technological advancements over the past 4 to 5 decades has led to an influx of electronic devices that helped to improve the lives of many. Technological breakthroughs such as microprocessors, light emitting diodes (LED), and lithium-ion batteries, they are almost to be found everywhere in our modern-day consumer electronics: TVs, speakers, displays, computers, lighting, and many more. In this information era, it is almost impossible for us to carry out our day-to-day routines without relying on consumer electronics. According to Ambaye (2020), the demand for rare earth materials has increased significantly over the years because of their extensive use [1], with the commonly sourced being praseodymium, cerium, lanthanum, neodymium, samarium, and gadolinium due to their abundance throughout the globe. This also led to an increase in areas around the world being converted to rare earth mining spots. Context Rare earth materialsâ impact towards humans According to Liangâs (2018) investigation, the increase in residual materials that were discarded, and the pollution caused by them in the environment has led to essence of the materials being present in the human body through the food chain [2]. Zhang (2014) evaluated the reproductive toxicity of Sm (Samarium) in testicular lesions of male ICR mice given a continuous oral administration of Sm nitrate for 90 days. They found that the Sm targeted the testis because it showed a decrease in testicular sperm and spermatogenic cells [3]. All of which sounds dangerous, but it can be under control if traces of material residue are out of reach from civilisation. Research carried out by Liang (2018) found that children that are studying near the Bayan Obo mining area have traces of rare earth elements in their urine samples, so as the adults working or living near the mine. Even though the research did not find a link between the exposure of rare earth materials in drinking water and the health of the nearby residents, it is still mind boggling that organizations did not take any action to prevent or cure health issues that arise during material extraction. Furthermore, Figure 1: Donut 4 | P age according to Kantâs principle of consistency, if every tech organization allows its employees to risk catching infections or long-term health damage for the sake of meeting demands, more and more people are going to get infected. Based on the act of Utilitarianism, it is considered as unethical because the end results in more harming than happiness to the group. It is also unethical based on Kantâs principle of Interaction because organizations sacrificed their workerâs and public health over their own interests, profits. Rare earth materials polluting the environment The extensive use of rare earth elements can potentially lead to severe contamination of the surrounding environment. This includes agriculture, aquatic life, and soil, which can directly or indirectly affect the public health. According to Kyung (2016), he found 5 | P age the damage done by rare earth mining towards nature including organ and general body defects to animals, and growth inhibition and a reduction of chlorophyll production in plants. He also questioned the high demand for rare earth materials in several applications, yet very little information on its effects on human health and the environment [4]. This question alone already shows that organizations are not concerned about the public health, regardless of if they are aware about this issue or not. Weng (2013) stated that the deposit types of the rare earth materials can influence environmental effects, and that materials with radioactive properties in ores is the most common concern [5]. According to the Act of Utilitarianism, the organizations are unethical because the ignorance or the lack of prevention nor cure will harm not only their clients, but also the general public. This also unethical according to the Rule of Utilitarianism and Kantâs Rule of Universality because the pollution caused by organization not only shows that they are irresponsible, but it also caused harm towards public health. Who to blame? China? Barakos (2016) stated that despite the spur in exploration activities, the global production of rare earth materials remains small, and majority of the operations are still based in China [6]. That statement was 6 years old; China is not the only country that is guilty of excessive mining but is still considered notorious in the rare earth industry. Harvard International Review stated that Chinaâs dominance over the rare earth industry was only because they cut corners by laxing environmental regulations, usage of low cost and high pollution methods. However, without Chinaâs corner cutting strategies, consumers all around the world might not be able to purchase their devices at an affordable price. So, who is there to blame, the consumers demanding for affordable devices, the organizations that mishandle the sourcing, or China with its laxed pollution enforcement to meet consumer demand? Ethical Recommendation Based on the context stated above, it is not ethical to source rare earth materials used as components in high-technology devices. This is because organizations and countries are competing for rare earth extraction to meet demands, which eventually led to sacrifices to public and environmental health. Organizations can extend their support towards their legacy devices. The extended support for legacy devices meant that consumers could maximize the usage of their devices and without worrying about it becoming useless or obsolete. However, organizations continue to provide support for legacy devices, which means they still have to allocate some of their costs for tooling, knowledge, and blueprints, which will reduce their revenues. According to the Act of Altruism, this is considered ethical because organizations made the lives of its customers easier even if it meant losing some profits. Organizations can also incorporate or replace rare earth materials with something renewable or recyclable. By doing so, less rare earth materials are required to be 6 | P age sourced and extracted as their demands slowly decreases in favour of recycled or renewable materials. Organizations can also save a fortune in their development costs in the long run as rare earth materials will continue to deplete and prices will eventually skyrocket. Manufacturers can start by slowly phase out the usage of rare earth materials and incorporate some renewable or recycled materials into their components (aluminium, plastic). At the very least, manufacturers can try to reduce the usage of rare earth materials in their products by re-engineering them to be smaller and more compact without sacrificing performance. In other words, it does not need to be bulkier that it needs to be. Both recommendations are also considered ethical according to Kantâs principle of consistency. This is because if every organization extends their support for legacy devices and to use renewable materials for new devices, this could mean a significant reduction in rare earth materials usage. This also results in a cleaner environment and lesser risk of toxic waste exposure to the public. This also obeys Kantâs rule of Universality as these solutions would prove that the organizations are responsible as they change their ways of doing. Conclusion Based on the ethical dilemmas and explanations stated above, the act of sourcing rare earth materials is unanimously viewed by various research as unethical; corner cutting and improper disposal of rare earth sourcing all for the sake of meeting demands for a quick profit. The goal here is not to condemn the organizations that sourced rare earth materials, but to suggest alternatives that are somewhat more ethical that what they are currently doing so that they could produce lesser environmental and health impacts without affecting their business.

        self.assertEqual(main.utf_decoding(self.element.extractedText), {"input_text": "The Greek historian knew what he was talking about. The Nile River fed Egyptian civilization for hundreds of years. The Longest River the Nile is 4,160 miles long the worlds longest river. It begins near the equator in Africa and flows north to the Mediterranean Sea. In the south the Nile churns with cataracts. A cataract is a waterfall. Near the sea the Nile branches into a delta. A delta is an area near a rivers mouth where the water deposits fine soil called silt. In the delta, the Nile divides into many streams. The river is called the upper Nile in the south and the lower Nile in the north. For centuries, heavy rains in Ethiopia caused the Nile to flood every summer. The floods deposited rich soil along the Niles shores. This soil was fertile, which means it was good for growing crops. Unlike the Tigris and Euphrates, the Nile River flooded at the same time every year, so farmers could predict when to plant their crops. Red Land, Black Land The ancient Egyptians lived in narrow bands of land on each side of the Nile. They called this region the black land because of the fertile soil that the floods deposited. The red land was the barren desert beyond the fertile region. Weather in Egypt was almost always the same. Eight months of the year were sunny and hot. The four months of winter were sunny but cooler. Most of the region received only an inch of rain a year. The parts of Egypt not near the Nile were a desert. Isolation The harsh desert acted as a barrier to keep out enemies. The Mediterranean coast was swampy and lacked good harbors. For these reasons, early Egyptians stayed close to home. Each year, Egyptian farmers watched for white birds called ibises, which flew up from the south. When the birds arrived, the annual flood waters would soon follow. After the waters drained away, farmers could plant seeds in the fertile soil. Agricultural Techniques By about 2400 B.C., farmers used technology to expand their farmland. Working together, they dug irrigation canals that carried river water to dry areas. Then they used a tool called a shaduf to spread the water across the fields. These innovative, or new, techniques gave them more farmland. Egyptian Crops Ancient Egyptians grew a large variety of foods. They were the first to grind wheat into flour and to mix the flour with yeast and water to make dough rise into bread. They grew vegetables such as lettuce, radishes, asparagus, and cucumbers. Fruits included dates, figs, grapes, and watermelons. Egyptians also grew the materials for their clothes. They were the first to weave fibers from flax plants into a fabric called linen. Lightweight linen cloth was perfect for hot Egyptian days. Men wore linen wraps around their waists. Women wore loose, sleeveless dresses. Egyptians also wove marsh grasses into sandals. Egyptian Houses Egyptians built houses using bricks made of mud from the Nile mixed with chopped straw. They placed narrow windows high in the walls to reduce bright sunlight. Egyptians often painted walls white to reflect the blazing heat. They wove sticks and palm trees to make roofs. Inside, woven reed mats covered the dirt floor. Most Egyptians slept on mats covered with linen sheets. Wealthy citizens enjoyed bed frames and cushions. Egyptian nobles had fancier homes with tree lined courtyards for shade. Some had a pool filled with lotus blossoms and fish. Poorer Egyptians simply went to the roof to cool off after sunset. They often cooked, ate, and even slept outside. Egypts economy depended on farming. However, the natural resources of the area allowed other economic activities to develop too. The Egyptians wanted valuable metals that were not found in the black land. For example, they wanted copper to make tools and weapons. Egyptians looked for copper as early as 6000 B.C. Later they learned that iron was stronger, and they sought it as well. Ancient Egyptians also desired gold for its bright beauty. The Egyptian word for gold was nub. Nubia was the Egyptian name for the area of the upper Nile that had the richest gold mines in Africa. Mining minerals was difficult. Veins (long streaks) of copper, iron, and bronze were hidden inside desert mountains in the hot Sinai Peninsula, east of Egypt. Even during the cool season, chipping minerals out of the rock was miserable work. Egyptians mined precious stones too. They were probably the first people in the world to mine turquoise. The Egyptians also mined lapis lazuli. These beautiful blue stones were used in jewelry.The Nile had fish and other wildlife that Egyptians wanted. To go on the river, Egyptians made lightweight rafts by binding together reeds. They used everything from nets to harpoons to catch fish. One ancient painting even shows a man ready to hit a catfish with a wooden hammer. More adventurous hunters speared hippopotamuses and crocodiles along the Nile. Egyptians also captured quail with nets. They used boomerangs to knock down flying ducks and geese. (A boomerang is a curved stick that returns to the person who threw it.) Eventually, Egyptians equipped their reed boats with sails and oars. The Nile then became a highway. The rivers current was slow, so boaters used paddles to go faster when they traveled north with the current. Going south, they raised a sail and let the winds that blew in that direction push them. The Nile provided so well for Egyptians that sometimes they had surpluses, or more goods than they needed. They began to trade with each other. Ancient Egypt had no money, so people exchanged goods that they grew or made. This method of trade is called bartering. Egypt prospered along the Nile. This prosperity made life easier and provided greater opportunities for many Egyptians. When farmers produce food surpluses, the societys economy begins to expand. Cities emerge as centers of culture and power, and people learn to do jobs that do not involve agriculture. For example, some ancient Egyptians learned to be scribes, people whose job was to write and keep records. As Egyptian civilization grew more complex, people took on jobs other than that of a farmer or scribe. Some skilled artisans erected stone or brick houses and temples. Other artisans made pottery, incense, mats, furniture, linen clothing, sandals, or jewelry. A few Egyptians traveled to the upper Nile to trade with other Africans. These traders took Egyptian products such as scrolls, linen, gold, and jewelry. They brought back exotic woods, animal skins, and live beasts. As Egypt grew, so did its need to organize. Egyptians created a government that divided the empire into 42 provinces. Many officials worked to keep the provinces running smoothly. Egypt also created an army to defend itself. One of the highest jobs in Egypt was to be a priest. Priests followed formal rituals and took care of the temples. Before entering a temple, a priest bathed and put on special linen garments and white sandals. Priests cleaned the sacred statues in temples, changed their clothes, and even fed them meals. Together, the priests and the ruler held ceremonies to please the gods. Egyptians believed that if the gods were angry, the Nile would not flood. As a result, crops would not grow, and people would die. So the ruler and the priests tried hard to keep the gods happy. By doing so, they hoped to maintain the social and political order. Slaves were at the bottom of society. In Egypt, people became slaves if they owed a debt, committed a crime, or were captured in war. Egyptian slaves were usually freed after a period of time. One exception was the slaves who had to work in the mines. Many died from the exhausting labor. Egypt was one of the best places in the ancient world to be a woman. Unlike other ancient African cultures, in Egyptian society men and women had fairly equal rights. For example, they could both own and manage their own property. The main job of most women was to care for their children and home, but some did other jobs too. Some women wove cloth. Others worked with their husbands in fields or workshops. Some women, such as Queen Tiy, even rose to important positions in the government. Children in Egypt played with toys such as dolls, animal figures, board games, and marbles. Their parents made the toys from wood or clay. Boys and girls also played rough physical games with balls made of leather or reeds. Boys and some girls from wealthy families went to schools run by scribes or priests. Most other children learned their parents jobs. Almost all Egyptians married when they were in their early teens. As in many ancient societies, much of the knowledge of Egypt came about as priests studied the world to find ways to please the gods. Other advances came about because of practical discoveries. Egyptian priests studied the sky as part of their religion. About 5,000 years ago, they noticed that a star now called Sirius appeared shortly before the Nile began to flood. The star returned to the same position in 365 days. Based on that, Egyptians developed the worlds first practical calendar. The Egyptians developed some of the first geometry. Each year the Niles floods washed away land boundaries. To restore property lines, surveyors measured the land by using ropes that were knotted at regular intervals. Geometric shapes such as squares and triangles were sacred to Egyptians. Architects used them in the design of royal temples and monuments. Egyptian doctors often prepared dead bodies for burial, so they knew the parts of the body. That knowledge helped them perform some of the worlds first surgery. Some doctors specialized in using medicines made of herbs. Egyptian medicine was far from perfect. Doctors believed that the heart controlled thought and the brain circulated blood, which is the opposite of what is known now. Some Egyptian treatments would raise eyebrows today. One cure for an upset stomach was to eat a hogs tooth crushed inside sugar cakes! Beginning about 3000 B.C., Egyptians developed a writing system using hieroglyphs. Hieroglyphs Hieroglyphs are pictures that stand for different words or sounds. Early Egyptians created a hieroglyphic system with about 700 characters. Over time the system grew to include more than 6,000 symbols. The Egyptians also developed a paperlike material called papyrus papyrus from a reed of the same name. Egyptians cut the stems into strips, pressed them, and dried them into sheets that could be rolled into scrolls. Papyrus scrolls were light and easy to carry. With them, Egyptians created some of the first books. Legend says a king named Narmer united Upper and Lower Egypt. Some historians think Narmer actually represents several kings who gradually joined the two lands. After Egypt was united, its ruler wore the Double Crown. It combined the red Crown of Lower Egypt with the white Crown of Upper Egypt. The first dynasty of the Egyptian empire began about 2925 B.C. A dynasty is a line of rulers from the same family. When a king died, one of his children usually took his place as ruler. The order in which members of a royal family inherit a throne is called the succession. More than 30 dynasties ruled ancient Egypt. Historians divide ancient Egyptian dynasties into the Old Kingdom, the Middle Kingdom, and the New Kingdom. The Old Kingdom started about 2575 B.C., when the Egyptian empire was gaining strength. The king of Egypt became known as the pharaoh pharaoh. The word pharaoh meant great house, and it was originally used to describe the kings palace. Later it became the title of the king himself. The pharaoh ruled from the capital city of Memphis. The ancient Egyptians thought the pharaoh was a child of the gods and a god himself. Egyptians believed that if the pharaoh and his subjects honored the gods, their lives would be happy. If Egypt suffered hard times for a long period, the people blamed the pharaoh for angering the gods. In such a case, a rival might drive him from power and start a new dynasty. Because the pharaoh was thought to be a god, government and religion were not separate in ancient Egypt. Priests had much power in the government. Many high officials were priests. The first rulers of Egypt were often buried in an underground tomb topped by mud brick. Soon, kings wanted more permanent monuments. They replaced the mud brick with a small pyramid of brick or stone. A pyramid is a structure shaped like a triangle, with four sides that meet at a point. About 2630 B.C., King Djoser built a much larger pyramid over his tomb. It is called a step pyramid because its sides rise in a series of giant steps. It is the oldest known large stone structure in the world. About 80 years later, a pharaoh named Khufu decided he wanted a monument that would show the world how great he was. He ordered the construction of the largest pyramid ever built. Along its base, each side was about 760 feet long. The core was built from 2.3 million blocks of stone. Building the Great Pyramid was hard work. Miners cut the huge blocks of stone using copper saws and chisels. These tools were much softer than the iron tools developed later. Other teams of workers pulled the stone slabs up long, sloping ramps to their place on the pyramid. Near the top of the pyramid, the ramps ended. Workers dragged each heavy block hundreds of feet and then set it in place. Farmers did the heavy labor of hauling stone during the season when the Nile flooded their fields. Skilled stonecutters and overseers worked year round. The Great Pyramid took nearly 20 years to build. An estimated 20,000 Egyptians worked on it. A city called Giza was built for the pyramid workers and the people who fed, clothed, and housed them. Eventually, Egyptians stopped building pyramids. One reason is that the pyramids drew attention to the tombs inside them. Grave robbers broke into the tombs to steal the treasure buried with the pharaohs. Sometimes they also stole the mummies. Egyptians believed that if a tomb was robbed, the person buried there could not have a happy afterlife. During the New Kingdom, pharaohs began building more secret tombs in an area called the Valley of the Kings. The burial chambers were hidden in mountains near the Nile. This way, the pharaohs hoped to protect their bodies and treasures from robbers. Both the pyramids and later tombs had several passageways leading to different rooms. This was to confuse grave robbers about which passage to take. Sometimes relatives, such as the queen, were buried in the extra rooms. Tombs were supposed to be the palaces of pharaohs in the afterlife. Mourners filled the tomb with objects ranging from food to furniture that the mummified pharaoh would need. Some tombs contained small statues that were supposed to be servants for the dead person. Egyptian artists decorated royal tombs with wall paintings and sculptures carved into the walls. Art was meant to glorify both the gods and the dead person. A sculpture of a dead pharaoh had perfect features, no matter how he really looked. Artists also followed strict rules about how to portray humans. Paintings showed a persons head, arms, and legs from the side. They showed the front of the body from the neck down to the waist. Wall paintings showed pharaohs enjoying themselves so they could have a happy afterlife. One favorite scene was of the pharaoh fishing in a papyrus marsh. Warlike kings were often portrayed in battle. Scenes might also show people providing for the needs of the dead person. Such activities included growing and preparing food, caring for animals, and building boats. As hard as the pharaohs tried to hide themselves, robbers stole the treasures from almost every tomb. Only a secret tomb built for a New Kingdom pharaoh was ever found with much of its treasure untouched. The dazzling riches found in this tomb show how much wealth the pharaohs spent preparing for the afterlife. By about 2130 B.C., Egyptian kings began to lose their power to local rulers of the provinces. For about 500 more years, the kings held Egypt together, but with a much weaker central government. This period of Egyptian history is called the Middle Kingdom. Rulers during the Middle Kingdom also faced challenges from outside Egypt. A nomadic people called the Hyksos invaded Egypt from the northeast. Their army conquered by using better weapons and horse drawn chariots, which were new to Egyptians. After about 100 years, the Egyptians drove out the Hyksos and began the New Kingdom.", "max_questions":25})

The study will deepen the knowledge of the relationship between digital connectivity infrastructure and the indigenous community. It also provides ideas and suggestions for a design solution for improving the current conditions in the assigned township, Borroloola, Northern Territory. Digital Infrastructure Challenges that faced by Orange Asli Community in Malaysia In the past few decades, researchers have been working hard to find ways to overcome the digital infrastructure challenges faced by Indigenous communities, Orang Asli, the first nation people in the Malay peninsula. The indigenous communities in Malaysia have telecentres, internet connections and all essential information communication technologies. However, the provision of digital infrastructure only cures the symptoms but not the disease. A study conducted by Bala. P and Tan. CE. (2021) has explored and researched four Orang Asli communities telecentres and found that the underlying issue with digital infrastructure in the indigenous community is the lack of emergency technical support, lack of guidance and guidelines in solving critical technical issues and lack of training for indigenous people to learn new ICT equipment and perform tasks. I agree that Tan stated providing the infrastructure will only solve the surface issues but not the inner problem. Hence, it might need a remote management system to overcome challenges and adapt community's evolving needs. Distance education challenges that faced by Indigenous Community in Canada Education is essential for every community, including both indigenous and non indigenous communities. Every Individual has the right to a quality education. It educates individuals and helps to develop skills. For remote indigenous communities, digital distance education is the best way to help the indigenous student learn without the restriction of geography. Yet, some challenges need to be addressed. A research report prepared by Leask (as cited in ODonnell S et al., 2016) from Natuashish in Labrador studied the digital technologies in community 101231636 Research Report 4 schools and found that the lack of network connectivity heavily impacts the progress of digital distance education in the remote indigenous community. The unstable and slow connection makes specific education programs unavailable such as cloud library services, attendance taking tools and any interactive based websites. Besides, the lack of technology devices in the indigenous community compared to the technology filled community schools is also a factor that aggravated the distance education challenges and quality of education. Healthcare and Telehealth challenges that faced by Indigenous community in Canada Health plays a vital role in every community, especially the indigenous community. As the Indigenous community is far from the urban area, access to health care services will be limited. Hence, telehealth was introduced to communities and used as the primary healthcare service across Indigenous communities. Telehealth is a service that uses telecommunication networks to provide remote health support by phone call or video call. However, there are some underlying challenges that telehealth needs to encounter. Several researchers (as cited in ODonnell S et al., 2016) have documented a survey study on the perception of telemental health in two remote indigenous communities in Canada. The outcome of research shows that most Indigenous people have difficulties contacting external mental health workers. They are also having challenges in obtaining mental healthcare from their community. The reason behind this is that the telecommunication networks are not stable and constantly being out of range. Furthermore, the telehealth service must occur in the community health centre, making delivering mental health services more challenging. Challenges to ensuring public access and preservation ancient wisdom to Indigenous information in Africa Africa is a long historical standing country with much indigenous cultural heritage and ancient wisdom. But the preservation of cultural heritage such as languages, astrology, and agriculture knowledge is poor and faces challenging issues. A study conducted by Moseti and Mutula (as cited by Chowdhury. G et al.) in the Indigenous community in Kenya observed the lack of ICT infrastructure, ICT policies 101231636 Research Report 5 and standards, funding, and basic network infrastructures are the key to poor use of institutional repositories. Nevertheless, the issues in digital infrastructure in the indigenous community also bring up the concern of accessing digital information. Few researchers (as cited by Chowdhury. G et al.) argue that the supply of telecentres in Africa has remained slow and hardly maintains the basic needs. Results show that the high cost of internet access is a significant barrier for rural indigenous communities to access digital information. 1.1 Methodology A qualitative two stage methodology has been used in this literature review. The first stage of review is using the Historical Model, which is searching for the past ten years of a relevant event, report, government conference and journal that study about digital communication infrastructure challenges faced by the worldwide indigenous community, especially in finding the relation between inherent challenges and digital infrastructure in each indigenous community. The second stage of the review will use the Grounded Theory Method, which focuses on gathering and analysing essential information found in the first stage of research. It is to understand specific challenges that each indigenous community faces. 2 Project background This project will focus on one of the Australian Indigenous communities, Borroloola, Northern Territory, in researching and discussing the current state of digital connectivity infrastructure in the community. It also analyses the current challenges and demands of information communication technologies and services in Borroloola. 1.0 Project Description In this modern era, the convergence of information communication and computing technologies has rapidly developed. It has become essential in driving social development, including socio economy, education, health and more. Digital infrastructure, as the backbone of digital technology, should also be given much attention to ensure service 101231636 Research Report 6 availability. A few decades later, the Australian government found that the digital divide between the urban area and indigenous community has been gradually expanded, which might lead to negative impacts such as technology discrimination. All Indigenous communities, especially the Indigenous community, Borroloola, which reside in Northern Territory, should have access to the same digital opportunity as other states. 1.2 Problem Statement Borroloola is a remote community town in the Northern Territory of Australia, with under 1000 villagers. It faces many challenges in accessing and obtaining digital communication services. In general, Northern Territory has a vast territory and a highly dispersed population, which creates challenges in health, education, and telecommunications. Specifically, the Borroloola community faced accommodation issues in which no electricity or water was provided. A media report from Ryan. H (2019) has reported that aboriginal people live in harsh accommodations and environments, where houses lack basic amenities, there is the disrepair of accommodation and overcrowded residents. These issues will lead indigenous people to poor service accessibility, including telecommunication. Nevertheless, overcrowding has also led to sickness, and the spread of any disease will be rapid and deadly. The poor plumbing and sewerage in the Indigenous community will also potentially result in water pollution. Hence, there is an urgent need for digital technology services and communication technologies in the community. 101231636 Research Report 7 2 Project Goals and Objectives The goal of this project is to focus on the Indigenous community, Borroloola, Northern Territory, with their digital communication infrastructure needs. Project will be in line with telecommunications principles which consider Appropriateness, Affordability, Access and equity, Environmental health, Health and safety and Sustainable livelihoods. The first stage of goals will be researching Indigenous digital literacy, user accessibility, and affordability in the Borroloola community related to the communication infrastructure. Objectives will be examined the Indigenous community's access to digital communication technology in daily activities. Also, guarantee that essential application used in the Indigenous community is affordable and digitally literate. The second stage of goals will be examined current difficulties faced by the Indigenous community, explore the demand for communication technologies, and the needs for remote Indigenous communication services. The objectives of this goal will be to compare the population of Borroloola communities with communication coverage. Estimating overall capital needs for digital communication infrastructure in Borroloola. 3 Desired outcomes and benefits The desired outcomes and benefits for this project is improve the quality of life for Indigenous community by introduce and strengthen the digital communication infrastructure. It helps to improve health, education, transportation, socio economy, and pollution issues in Borroloola community. 101231636 Research Report 8 4 Learning issue/problem The learning issue I choose is the need for telehealth in the Borroloola community in relation to communication infrastructure and service. In the rural Indigenous area in Northern Territory, access to medical services is not as easy as people living in urban areas. They have travelled hundreds of kilometers to find a hospital. According to the Department of Health in Northern Territory (2015), in researching the uptake of telehealth in Indigenous townships including Alice Springs, Katherine, Tennant Creek, Borroloola Northern Territory and more between 2013/2014 and 2014/2015. Research shows that about 231% growth for patients and providers end in telehealth utilization. Based on the above statistics, we can assume that Borroloola Indigenous community require more telehealth services and is willing to accept the telehealth service offered by the government. However, the poor network connections might lead to service interruption and hinder telehealth growth in Northern Territory. A survey prepared by the Department of Health in Northern Territory (2015) and sent to clinicians who provide telehealth in NT shows that around 85% response says the telehealth service provides better service. But several clinicians also give feedback on bad connectivity. For example, in Central Australia, NT, the network infrastructure has experienced high bandwidth collapses or congestion and cannot get a reliable connection for daily basic needs, even telehealth. Australia Bureau of Statistics (as cited in Murtagh.D et al. 2017) stated that remote indigenous communities tend to have insufficient Internet speed, which makes the video type of conferencing services not reliable. Furthermore, Aboriginal Medical Services Alliance NT (as cited in Murtagh.D et al. 2017) also claimed that although some health centres in NT in 2015 had satellite quality for telehealth, none of them had adequate bandwidth to maintain a stable and quality line connection. Most of the bandwidth is reserved for accessing database clinical information systems and overlooked videoconferencing, which is the primary part of telehealth. In the same context, the digital communication infrastructure in Borroloola township might also face low bandwidth network connection issues. 101231636 Research Report 9 5 Project Scope and Exclusions The project scope of the whole project will be analyzed challenges faced by Borroloola regarding communication technologies and propose digital infrastructure solutions to address them. The project in scope will be finding six different learning issues in Borroloola, prioritizing the top four learning issues and offering digital connectivity infrastructure solutions. The out scope of the project will be actual implementation and deploy the solution proposal, as it must go through government consideration and involve many entities to collaborate with precise calculation. 6 Project Deliverables The project deliverables will be a final business case report which provide current challenges and learning issues of Borroloola community, along with the recommended solution proposed. 7 Project Management Plan 7.1 Timeline Digital Connectivity Infrastructure for Remote Indigenous Communications Week 6 Week 7 Week 8 Week 9 Week 10 Week 11 Week 12 Design and finalize design model Develop and evaluate prototype Testing prototype and redesign Table 1: Project Timeline 101231636 Research Report 10 7.2 Goals and Milestones Goal: Design and finalize the design model Milestone: Complete the research report and get feedback from the tutor Milestone: Design prototype with team members.

        self.assertEqual(main.utf_decoding(self.element3.extractedText), {"input_text":"Introduction: The boom in technological advancements over the past 4 to 5 decades has led to an influx of electronic devices that helped to improve the lives of many. Technological breakthroughs such as microprocessors, light emitting diodes (LED), and lithium ion batteries, they are almost to be found everywhere in our modern day consumer electronics: TVs, speakers, displays, computers, lighting, and many more. In this information era, it is almost impossible for us to carry out our day to day routines without relying on consumer electronics. According to Ambaye (2020), the demand for rare earth materials has increased significantly over the years because of their extensive use [1], with the commonly sourced being praseodymium, cerium, lanthanum, neodymium, samarium, and gadolinium due to their abundance throughout the globe. This also led to an increase in areas around the world being converted to rare earth mining spots. Context Rare earth materials impact towards humans According to Liangs (2018) investigation, the increase in residual materials that were discarded, and the pollution caused by them in the environment has led to essence of the materials being present in the human body through the food chain [2]. Zhang (2014) evaluated the reproductive toxicity of Sm (Samarium) in testicular lesions of male ICR mice given a continuous oral administration of Sm nitrate for 90 days. They found that the Sm targeted the testis because it showed a decrease in testicular sperm and spermatogenic cells [3]. All of which sounds dangerous, but it can be under control if traces of material residue are out of reach from civilisation. Research carried out by Liang (2018) found that children that are studying near the Bayan Obo mining area have traces of rare earth elements in their urine samples, so as the adults working or living near the mine. Even though the research did not find a link between the exposure of rare earth materials in drinking water and the health of the nearby residents, it is still mind boggling that organizations did not take any action to prevent or cure health issues that arise during material extraction. Furthermore, Figure 1: Donut 4 | P age according to Kants principle of consistency, if every tech organization allows its employees to risk catching infections or long term health damage for the sake of meeting demands, more and more people are going to get infected. Based on the act of Utilitarianism, it is considered as unethical because the end results in more harming than happiness to the group. It is also unethical based on Kants principle of Interaction because organizations sacrificed their workers and public health over their own interests, profits. Rare earth materials polluting the environment The extensive use of rare earth elements can potentially lead to severe contamination of the surrounding environment. This includes agriculture, aquatic life, and soil, which can directly or indirectly affect the public health. According to Kyung (2016), he found 5 | P age the damage done by rare earth mining towards nature including organ and general body defects to animals, and growth inhibition and a reduction of chlorophyll production in plants. He also questioned the high demand for rare earth materials in several applications, yet very little information on its effects on human health and the environment [4]. This question alone already shows that organizations are not concerned about the public health, regardless of if they are aware about this issue or not. Weng (2013) stated that the deposit types of the rare earth materials can influence environmental effects, and that materials with radioactive properties in ores is the most common concern [5]. According to the Act of Utilitarianism, the organizations are unethical because the ignorance or the lack of prevention nor cure will harm not only their clients, but also the general public. This also unethical according to the Rule of Utilitarianism and Kants Rule of Universality because the pollution caused by organization not only shows that they are irresponsible, but it also caused harm towards public health. Who to blame? China? Barakos (2016) stated that despite the spur in exploration activities, the global production of rare earth materials remains small, and majority of the operations are still based in China [6]. That statement was 6 years old; China is not the only country that is guilty of excessive mining but is still considered notorious in the rare earth industry. Harvard International Review stated that Chinas dominance over the rare earth industry was only because they cut corners by laxing environmental regulations, usage of low cost and high pollution methods. However, without Chinas corner cutting strategies, consumers all around the world might not be able to purchase their devices at an affordable price. So, who is there to blame, the consumers demanding for affordable devices, the organizations that mishandle the sourcing, or China with its laxed pollution enforcement to meet consumer demand? Ethical Recommendation Based on the context stated above, it is not ethical to source rare earth materials used as components in high technology devices. This is because organizations and countries are competing for rare earth extraction to meet demands, which eventually led to sacrifices to public and environmental health. Organizations can extend their support towards their legacy devices. The extended support for legacy devices meant that consumers could maximize the usage of their devices and without worrying about it becoming useless or obsolete. However, organizations continue to provide support for legacy devices, which means they still have to allocate some of their costs for tooling, knowledge, and blueprints, which will reduce their revenues. According to the Act of Altruism, this is considered ethical because organizations made the lives of its customers easier even if it meant losing some profits. Organizations can also incorporate or replace rare earth materials with something renewable or recyclable. By doing so, less rare earth materials are required to be 6 | P age sourced and extracted as their demands slowly decreases in favour of recycled or renewable materials. Organizations can also save a fortune in their development costs in the long run as rare earth materials will continue to deplete and prices will eventually skyrocket. Manufacturers can start by slowly phase out the usage of rare earth materials and incorporate some renewable or recycled materials into their components (aluminium, plastic). At the very least, manufacturers can try to reduce the usage of rare earth materials in their products by re engineering them to be smaller and more compact without sacrificing performance. In other words, it does not need to be bulkier that it needs to be. Both recommendations are also considered ethical according to Kants principle of consistency. This is because if every organization extends their support for legacy devices and to use renewable materials for new devices, this could mean a significant reduction in rare earth materials usage. This also results in a cleaner environment and lesser risk of toxic waste exposure to the public. This also obeys Kants rule of Universality as these solutions would prove that the organizations are responsible as they change their ways of doing. Conclusion Based on the ethical dilemmas and explanations stated above, the act of sourcing rare earth materials is unanimously viewed by various research as unethical; corner cutting and improper disposal of rare earth sourcing all for the sake of meeting demands for a quick profit. The goal here is not to condemn the organizations that sourced rare earth materials, but to suggest alternatives that are somewhat more ethical that what they are currently doing so that they could produce lesser environmental and health impacts without affecting their business.
