# Document-Submission-System
Document Submission System is a web application we developed which enables convenors to make informed decisions regarding plagiarism in a submitted document by students rather than letting the system decide.

There are 3 things that will help the convenor to evaluate a student's work:
1. Answers from the student MCQ (student have to answer 5 document-related MCQ question based on their submitted document)
2. Results from the web search (an advanced searching function to provide convenor / grader a list of website that student's document may refereced from)
3. Report analysis (perform sentiment and entity analysis on student's document)
